<h1>Co-Driver Buddy</h1>
<p>
Co-Driver Buddy is a handy tool for co-driver's in rallies to calculate their 
in-times based on their transit and out-times.

<h2>Using the Co-Driver Buddy</h2>

<h2>Making your own Co-Driver Buddy</h2>
<p>
I have not put a lot of time in stylizing this page. Sorry to those looking for that. This does show the three
steps necessary to make your own Co-Driver Buddy.
</p>

<h3>1. Print two Co-Driver Buddys.</h3>
<p>
I used a white card stock here.  Only one was printed in colour.  That one will be used as the base.

<h3>2. Cut out the inner and outer circles.</h3>
<p>
Someone else is probably better at cutting out circles than I am.

<h3>3. Attach the wheels together.</h3>
<p>
I used a basic paper tack.
